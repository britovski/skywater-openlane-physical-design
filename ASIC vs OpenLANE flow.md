# ASIC vs OpenLANE flow

Apart from performing the whole openlane flow using PICORV32a code, I got an opportunity to compare and find the differences between ASIC flow and the OpenLANE flow. Instead of
comparing individual steps, I will be comparing individual flows since there is a diff in the steps of building the chip. This gives us a clear idea on the pros and cons for us
w.r.t both flows.
